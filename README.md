# Conway's Game of Life is a famous cellular automaton among the computer science community.
## As the name suggests, this game showcases how communities succeed or die off due to its population.
### It is composed of four simple rules:
* Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbours dies, as if by underpopulation.
* Any live cell with two or three live neighbours lives on to the next generation.
* Any live cell with more than three live neighbours dies, as if by overpopulation.
* Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbours becomes a live cell, as if by reproduction.
